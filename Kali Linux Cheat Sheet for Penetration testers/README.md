Penetration testing (also called pen testing) is the practice of testing a computer system, network or Web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.

Kali Linux Cheat Sheet for Penetration testers is a high level overview for typical penetration testing environment ranging from nmap, sqlmap, ipv4, enumeration, fingerprinting etc. Always view man pages if you are in doubt or the commands are not working as outlined here (can be OS based, version based  changes etc.) for the operating system you are using (such as BlackBox, Black Ubuntu, ParrotSec OS, Debian, Ubuntu etc.). I’ve also referenced some guides that I found useful in different sections and it might come in handy.

# Recon and Enumeration

## NMAP Commands
Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
